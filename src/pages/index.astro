    question: 'What is a remote assistant?',
    answer: "Helm's remote assistants are hungry, humble and highly intelligent professionals and support you and your team in virtually any function. They work in your time zone and integrate with your team as deeply as you would like. Many of our client partners, within four months of hiring, say their remote assistant is as much a part of the team as the other people in their company."
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the challenges and benefits of a remote assistant?',
    answer: 'A remote assistant is often life-changing since they bring you freedom in work and out. Are your company, your department, or you hitting the ceiling and trying to figure out how to break through? The constraint is often bandwidth or capabilities. Hiring a remote assistant brings you both.\n\nIn times of change, remote assistants make it easier to grow or contract your team with agility.\n\nRates of remote workers are often between 25% and 50% of what you would pay in the US. The challenge, however, of a remote assistant comes into play for companies unable to hold remote meetings. Otherwise, the challenges are similar to those with a physically present team member.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How is Helm unique?',
    answer: 'The rigor Helm applies to your search goes far beyond that of any other staffing company.\n\nWe bring a deep background in organizational development and helping companies build organizational health. For decades, Helm\'s founder has helped other business owners scale their business and attract exceptional talent. Companies cannot do this if they don\'t themselves possess great talent. We have helped business owners make key hiring and firing decisions that have paved the way for the growth that followed.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does onboarding work?',
    answer: "You'll receive guidance from us on how to get your new hire started. Often your remote assistant can guide you through much of this process. Key elements typically include:\n\n- Enabling access to your software and systems\n- Connecting with stakeholders\n- Acclimating to key processes and how things get done\n- Setting a cadence for meetings or check-ins\n- Sharing any project (s) or goal (s) to start on"
  },
  {
    question: 'How long will it take to find the right remote assistant with Helm?',
    answer: 'On average it takes us three weeks to find the right match for you. We know that once you need to hire, everyday can be a painful and costly wait, but as most people know, the cost of hiring the wrong person is vastly greater. Sometimes we have the right match for you within our community, particularly as our community of professionals grows.'
